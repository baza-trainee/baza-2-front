				"text2": "A web designer is a specialist who creates the visual representation of a brand on the internet. They design the interfaces of websites, online stores, landing pages, and applications for clients. They handle both the logical and visual aspects of the product."
			},

				"text1": "A front-end developer is a programmer who develops the client-side part of a product—the elements of websites, programs, and applications that allow users to interact with them. They are responsible for creating a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing appearance of web pages across various devices and implementing animations and other effects.",
				"text2": "A front-end developer writes code and builds the part of the page that the user sees and interacts with. For example, every image, button, and text on this site was created by a front-end developer based on a designer's layout. It is an interesting job because each new line of code enhances the appearance and functionality of the site."

The frontend is the part of the website or application that users see in their browser. It includes headings, subheadings, images, links, and buttons. The backend, on the other hand, is the logic and functionality behind the operation of the website or application. It encompasses everything hidden under the hood—the mechanics of actions, data storage, and more."

				"text1": "A QA engineer is responsible for developing testing plans for applications and websites. They identify issues in the functionality of the product, and most importantly, they help prevent these issues from occurring in the future.",
